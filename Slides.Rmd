## Objectives

Reviewing the literature in economics using **weather and climate projections** data. Underlying in particular:

.pull-left-narrow[.right[
`r fontawesome::fa("chart-line")`
]]
.pull-right-wide[
.White.bg-Gold[Methods for quantifying economic impacts of climate change]
]

.pull-left-narrow[.right[
`r fontawesome::fa("cloud-sun-rain")`
]]
.pull-right-wide[
.White.bg-Gold[Some existing assessments]
]

--

Decreasing the **fixed costs** in manipulating weather and climate projections data

.pull-left-narrow[.right[
`r fontawesome::fa("database")`
]]
.pull-right-wide[
Pointing out to useful .White.bg-Gold[data resources and references]
]

.pull-left-narrow[.right[
`r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`
]]
.pull-right-wide[
Some .White.bg-Gold[basic climate data manipulation] using **R**
]

Convince you (if not already so), that climate change impacts are worrysome, with lots
of uncertainties, and that it's an interesting topic to conduct research on.

For this, its most important materials is weather and climate projection data. A lot of recent improvements on these data accessibility and tools to manipulate them: the challenge now is more to be able to focus directly on the rights resources, as the task might be daunting if you wrap your head around this for the first time. So we will target some resources and see how we can use them.

2024 as the hottest year on Earth since pre-industrial level. 1.5°C is reached for the first time. If we sustain in the following decade multiple years above the 1.5°C, it means will experience significant warming and above 2°C, IPCC warns against very high risks.

These six data sources are most widespread historical weather datasets, and are the ones used by World Meteorological Organization to track temperature changes with respect to pre-industrial level. We'll see later how to access some of them.

HadCRUT: CRU data from University of East Anglia
ECMWF ERA5: Data produced by EU Copernicus Climate Change Services and the Eruopean Institute for Weather Forecasts
NOAA: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US agency forecasting weather.
